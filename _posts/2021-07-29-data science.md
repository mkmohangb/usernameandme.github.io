Machine Learning
 - Bagging and Boosting
 - Xgboost, lightgbm, catboost
 - SVD, PCA, NMF
 - Hyperparameter optimization frameworks like Optuna, FLAML, Ax
 
NLP
- different tasks like Text classification, Zero-shot classification, Text generation, Text completion(mask filling), Token classification, Question Answering, Summarization, Translation.
- hugging face
- 3 categories of transformers namely GPT-like => auto-regressive, BERT-like => auto-encoding, BART/T5 like => sequence to sequence. All transformer models have been trained as language models with large amounts of raw text in a self-supervised fashion. (https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/4?fw=pt). Causal language modeling(output depends on past & present inputs) and masked language modeling(model predicts a masked word in a sentence).
